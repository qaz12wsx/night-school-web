        <p>A little boy asked his mother &quot;Why are you crying？&quot;<br>
          一個男孩問他的媽媽：『你為甚麼要哭呢？』</p>
        <p>&quot;Because I'm a woman,&quot; she told him.<br>
          媽媽說：『因為我是女人啊。』</p>
        <p>&quot;I don't understand,&quot; he said.<br>
          男孩說：『我不懂。』</p>
        <p>His mum just hugged him and said, &quot;And you never will&quot;<br>
          他媽媽抱起他說：『你永遠不會懂得。』</p>
        <p>Later the little boy asked his father, &quot;Why does mother seem to 
          cry for no reason?&quot;<br>
          後來小男孩就問他爸爸：『媽媽為甚麼毫無理由的哭呢？』</p>
        <p>&quot;All women cry for no reason,&quot; was all his dad could say.<br>
          『所有女人都這樣。』他爸爸回答。</p>

          The little boy grew up and became a man,<br>
          still wondering why women cry.<br>
          小男孩長成了一個男人，但仍舊不懂女人為甚麼哭泣。</p>
        <p>Finally he put in a call to God;<br>
          and when God got on the phone,<br>
          he asked, &quot;God, why do women cry so! easily?&quot;<br>
          最後，他打電話給上帝；當上帝拿起電話時，<br>
          他問道：『上帝，女人為甚麼那麼容易哭泣呢？』</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>God said: &quot;When I made the woman she had to be special.<br>
          I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world;<br>
          yet, gentle enough to give comfort&quot;<br>
          上帝回答說：<br>
          『當我創造女人時，讓她很特別。<br>
          我使她的肩膀能挑起整個世界的重擔；並且，又柔情似水。』</p>
        <p>&quot;I gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth<br>
          and the rejection that many times comes from her children&quot;<br>
          『我讓她的內心很堅強，<br>
          能夠承受分娩的痛苦和忍受自己孩子多次的拒絕。』</p>
        <p>&quot;I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his 
          wife,<br>
          but sometimes tests her strengths<br>
          and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly&quot;<br>
          『我賦予她耐心，使她在別人放棄的時候繼續堅持，<br>
          並且無怨無悔的照顧自己的家人，渡過疾病和疲勞。』</p>
        <p>&quot;I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any<br>
          and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly&quot;<br>
          『我賦予她在任何情況下，都會愛孩子的感情，即使她的孩子傷害了她。』</p>
        <p>&quot;I gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults<br>
          and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart&quot;<br>
          『我賦予她包容她丈夫過錯的堅強和用他的勒骨塑成她來保護他的心。』</p>
        <p>&quot;I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his 
          wife,<br>
          but sometimes tests her strengths<br>
          and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly&quot;<br>
          『我賦予她智慧，讓她知道一個好丈夫是絕不會傷害他的妻子的，<br>
          但有時我也會考驗她支持自己丈夫的決心和堅強。』</p>
        <p>&quot;And finally, I gave her a tear to shed.<br>
          This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed.&quot;<br>
          『最後，我讓她可以流淚。只要她願意。這是她所獨有的。』</p>
        <p>&quot;You see: The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears,<br>
          the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.&quot;!<br>
          『你看，女人的漂亮不是因為她穿的衣服、<br>
          她保持的體型或者她梳頭的方式。』</p>
        <p>&quot;The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes,<br>
          because that is the doorway to her heart<br>
          * the place where love resides.&quot;<br>
          『女人的漂亮，必須從她的眼睛中去看，<br>
          因為那是她心靈的窗戶和愛居住的地方。』</p>
